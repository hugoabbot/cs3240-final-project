# RA.Connect

RA.Connect is a web application designed to streamline University of Virginia dorm residents to their resident advisors (RAs). The project was a semester-long group [assignment](https://s24.cs3240.org/project.html#project-overview) for CS 3240 (Advanced Software Development Techniques) and should **not** be used for serious reports.

## Online Usage

The web app can be directly accessed and tested through our [Heroku](https://b-30-a1951ad3d5cd.herokuapp.com/) deployment.

## Local Installation

If your usage is only local, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependencies listed on the provided requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Furthermore, the following inputs should be made in the root directory to make sure the local databse is properly configured:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Local Usage

After installation, run the following commands to start the web app:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

and access it through the link [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
